# SPACE SHMUP

A game I wrote using a codebase I built. The base is a common structure 
I have used with a few other projects.
  * [BLAST DEM BOTS](https://github.com/goldDaniel/BLAST_DEM_BOTS)
  * [UNNAMED PLATFORMER](https://github.com/goldDaniel/platformer_project)

#Things I did poorly but learned from
  * At the end of the project I really started feeling the constraints
    that I set for myself in regards to my architecture. Next project
    will have a rewrite of this main codebase, and there will be a more
    layered approach
  * Originally I had planned to have a full level with different enemies,
    and upgrades to the player ship. After I while I realized how out of 
    scope that really was and focused on making the one fight
  * UI is hard, I used a free skin from [here](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-skins)
#Things I feel I did well
  * I love how self contained and simple my bullet spawners were.
    you give it some variables and it would do the behaviour that 
    was expected. Thanks to the object oriented nature, I could
    then take these self contained spawners and manipulate the inputs
    to make very good effects and patterns. I will use something similar
    for my next particle system
  
## Built With [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
